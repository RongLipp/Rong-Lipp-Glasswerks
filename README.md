# Rong-Lipp-Glasswerks
Hopefully my art glass web site
I need to build a web site that has a good bit of functionality.  I design and fire fused glass cabochons.  Each is unique and I have found a friend who takes great pictures.  I need to design the site so that I can upload hundreds of photos, each an item in inventory, and then have them marked as sold when somone choses to purchase one.  It will need to handle the back end transaction with credit and debit cards as well.
